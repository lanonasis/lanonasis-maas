## ✅ Validation Commands

Run these commands to verify the implementation:

```bash
# Check all critical files exist
echo "=== Critical Files Check ==="
[ -f LICENSE ] && echo "✅ LICENSE exists" || echo "❌ LICENSE missing"
[ -f .prettierrc.json ] && echo "✅ Prettier config exists" || echo "❌ Prettier missing"
[ -f .editorconfig ] && echo "✅ EditorConfig exists" || echo "❌ EditorConfig missing"

# Count test files and cases
echo -e "\n=== Test Coverage ==="
echo "Test files: $(find tests -name "*.test.ts" | wc -l)"
echo "Test cases: $(grep -r "it(" tests | wc -l)"

# Run tests
echo -e "\n=== Running Tests ==="
npm test

# Check git status
echo -e "\n=== Git Status ==="
git status --short
```

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### What Worked Well:
1. **Clear audit comparison** made priorities obvious
2. **Test structure** easy to extend
3. **Configuration files** standard and well-documented
4. **Documentation** comprehensive and actionable

### Challenges Encountered:
1. **TypeScript strict mode** required type assertions in tests
2. **Jest configuration** needed ESM adjustments
3. **Coverage thresholds** had to start conservative (25%)

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Start with legal compliance** - it's a blocker
2. **Test infrastructure first** - enables everything else
3. **Incremental coverage targets** - 25% → 50% → 80%
4. **Document as you go** - critical for team alignment
