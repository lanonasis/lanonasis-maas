# Publishing Summary - Final Status

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Code Alignment
- All code from vibe-memory copied to LanOnasis-maas
- Package.json files fixed (removed -dev suffixes and private flags)
- .gitignore updated in both repositories to exclude secrets

### 2. GitHub Actions Secrets
- Script created: `configure-github-secrets.sh`
- Test configuration script created with placeholder values
- Ready to run with real credentials

### 3. VS Code Extension (v1.2.0)
- ✅ Code updated with API key management features
- ✅ Compiled successfully
- ✅ VSIX package created: `LanOnasis-memory-1.2.0.vsix`
- 📍 Location: `/Users/seyederick/DevOps/_project_folders/LanOnasis-maas/vscode-extension/LanOnasis-memory-1.2.0.vsix`

### 4. NPM Packages Status
- **@LanOnasis/cli** - ✅ Already published at v1.2.0
- **@LanOnasis/memory-client** - ✅ Ready to publish (dist exists)
- **@LanOnasis/sdk** - ⚠️ Needs building before publish

## 🚀 Publishing Commands

### VS Code Extension
```bash
vsce publish -p <your-vsce-token> --packagePath /Users/seyederick/DevOps/_project_folders/LanOnasis-maas/vscode-extension/LanOnasis-memory-1.2.0.vsix
```

### NPM Packages
Due to workspace conflicts, you'll need to run these commands from a different terminal or after resolving the conflicts:

#### @LanOnasis/memory-client
```bash
cd /Users/seyederick/DevOps/_project_folders/LanOnasis-maas/packages/memory-client
npm publish --access public
```

#### @LanOnasis/sdk
```bash
cd /Users/seyederick/DevOps/_project_folders/LanOnasis-maas/packages/LanOnasis-sdk
npm run build  # or: tsc && tsc-alias
npm publish --access public
```

## 🔒 Security Status
- ✅ No secrets committed to version control
- ✅ .gitignore properly configured
- ✅ Test scripts with placeholder values created (not committed)

## ⚠️ Workspace Conflict Resolution
The workspace naming conflicts prevent npm/npx commands from running. To resolve:

1. **Option 1**: Temporarily rename one of the conflicting packages
2. **Option 2**: Use a fresh terminal session
3. **Option 3**: Remove one of the workspace directories from npm's global config

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Publish VS Code extension with the command above
2. Build and publish @LanOnasis/sdk
3. Publish @LanOnasis/memory-client
4. Test all published packages
5. Update GitHub Actions secrets with real values
