```sql
-- New types
CREATE TYPE memory_state AS ENUM ('active', 'paused', 'archived', 'deleted');

-- New tables
memory_state_transitions  -- Audit trail
memory_access_rules       -- ACL system

-- New columns
ALTER TABLE memory_entries ADD COLUMN state memory_state;
ALTER TABLE memory_entries ADD COLUMN app_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE memory_entries ADD COLUMN archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
ALTER TABLE memory_entries ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- New function
update_memory_state()     -- Atomic state updates
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

### Files Changed
- **Total**: 23 files
- **Insertions**: +348 lines
- **Deletions**: -3,654 lines
- **Net**: -3,306 lines (code cleanup)

### Key Files
- `README-ENHANCED.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `src/db/schema-enhanced-mem0.sql` - Database schema
- `src/services/memoryService-enhanced.ts` - Core service
- `cli/src/mcp/memory-state.ts` - State management
- `cli/src/mcp/access-control.ts` - Access control
- `cli/src/mcp/vector-store.ts` - Vector store integration
- `docker-compose.enhanced.yml` - Infrastructure

### Breaking Changes
⚠️ **Yes** - New database schema requires migration

**Migration Path**:
1. Run `src/db/schema-enhanced-mem0.sql` on existing database
2. Existing memories will default to `state='active'`
3. No data loss - fully backward compatible
