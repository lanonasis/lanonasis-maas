# GitHub Workflow Review - CLI Auto-Publishing

## 🔍 Current Workflow Analysis

### File: `.github/workflows/publish-cli-trusted.yml`

**Status**: ✅ Well-configured with modern best practices

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

### 1. **Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** ✅
- Uses `id-token: write` permission
- No NPM tokens needed in secrets
- Enhanced security with provenance attestations
- Modern npm publishing approach

### 2. **Dual Trigger Support** ✅
- **Auto-publish**: On push to `main` with CLI changes
- **Manual publish**: Via workflow_dispatch with version input
- Flexible deployment options

### 3. **Build & Test Pipeline** ✅
- Installs dependencies with Bun
- Builds CLI
- Tests CLI functionality (`--version`, `--help`)
- Validates before publishing

### 4. **Provenance Attestations** ✅
- Uses `--provenance` flag
- Provides supply chain security
- Verifiable package origin

## ⚠️ Issues & Required Fixes

### Issue 1: **Workflow Won't Trigger from Current Branch** 🔴

**Problem**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]  # ← Only triggers on main
```

**Current Situation**:
- We're on `mem0-inspired-enhancements` branch
- Workflow won't trigger until merged to `main`
- Can't auto-publish v3.0.3 yet

**Solutions**:

**Option A**: Merge to main first (Recommended)
```bash
# Merge branch to main
git checkout main
git merge mem0-inspired-enhancements
git push origin main
# Workflow will auto-trigger
```

**Option B**: Add branch to workflow temporarily
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, mem0-inspired-enhancements ]  # Add current branch
```

**Option C**: Use manual workflow dispatch
```bash
# Go to GitHub Actions → Publish CLI Package
# Click "Run workflow"
# Enter version: 3.0.3
```

### Issue 2: **NPM Trusted Publishing Not Configured** 🟡

**Problem**: Workflow requires NPM trusted publishing setup

**Check if configured**:
1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/settings/lanonasis/packages
2. Look for "Publishing" or "Automation tokens"
3. Check if GitHub Actions is listed as trusted publisher

**If not configured**:
1. Go to npmjs.com → Account Settings → Publishing
2. Add GitHub Actions as trusted publisher:
   - **Repository**: `lanonasis/lanonasis-maas`
   - **Workflow**: `publish-cli-trusted.yml`
   - **Environment**: (leave blank)

**Fallback**: If trusted publishing isn't set up, workflow will fail. Use manual npm publish instead.

### Issue 3: **Version Mismatch Handling** 🟡

**Problem**: Workflow doesn't check if version already exists on npm

**Current behavior**:
- If v3.0.3 already exists on npm, publish will fail
- No version bump logic for auto-publish

**Recommendation**: Add version check
```yaml
- name: Check if version exists
  run: |
    cd cli
    CURRENT_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
    if npm view @lanonasis/cli@$CURRENT_VERSION version 2>/dev/null; then
      echo "Version $CURRENT_VERSION already exists on npm"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### Issue 4: **Bun vs NPM Inconsistency** 🟡

**Current setup**:
- Uses Bun for install/build
- Uses npm for publishing
- Could cause dependency resolution differences

**Recommendation**: Consider using npm throughout for consistency
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '20'
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: cli/package-lock.json

- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    cd cli
    npm ci  # Use npm instead of bun

- name: Build CLI
  run: |
    cd cli
    npm run build  # Use npm instead of bun
```

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Before Auto-Publish Works)

1. **Check NPM Trusted Publishing Setup**
   ```bash
   # Verify on npmjs.com
   # If not set up, use manual publish for v3.0.3
   ```

2. **Manual Publish v3.0.3 Now**
   ```bash
   cd cli
   npm publish --access public
   ```

3. **Merge to Main After Testing**
   ```bash
   # After v3.0.3 is tested and working
   git checkout main
   git merge mem0-inspired-enhancements
   git push origin main
   ```

### Short-term (Next Release)

4. **Add Version Check to Workflow**
   - Prevent duplicate version publishes
   - Add clear error messages

5. **Consider npm-only Pipeline**
   - Remove Bun dependency
   - Use npm ci for consistency
   - Simpler CI/CD

6. **Add Notification Step**
   - Slack/Discord webhook on publish
   - Email notification
   - GitHub issue comment

### Long-term (Future Improvements)

7. **Automated Version Bumping**
   - Use semantic-release
   - Auto-generate changelogs
   - Tag releases automatically

8. **Pre-publish Checks**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check for breaking changes
   - Validate package contents

9. **Rollback Mechanism**
   - Automated rollback on failure
   - Version deprecation workflow
   - Emergency unpublish procedure

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy for v3.0.3

### Option 1: Manual Publish (Recommended for v3.0.3)

**Why**: 
- Workflow not configured for current branch
- Need to verify trusted publishing setup
- First critical release with auth fix

**Steps**:
```bash
cd cli
npm publish --access public
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Immediate deployment
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ No workflow dependencies

**Cons**:
- ❌ Manual process
- ❌ No automated checks

### Option 2: Manual Workflow Dispatch

**Why**: Test the workflow before auto-publish

**Steps**:
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Select "Publish CLI Package (Trusted Publishing)"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `mem0-inspired-enhancements`
5. Enter version: `3.0.3`

**Pros**:
- ✅ Tests workflow
- ✅ Automated checks
- ✅ Provenance attestations

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires trusted publishing setup
- ❌ May fail if not configured

### Option 3: Merge to Main First

**Why**: Enable auto-publish for future releases

**Steps**:
```bash
# Test v3.0.3 manually first
cd cli && npm publish --access public

# Then merge to main
git checkout main
git merge mem0-inspired-enhancements
git push origin main

# Future CLI changes will auto-publish
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Enables auto-publish
- ✅ Future releases automated
- ✅ Workflow tested

**Cons**:
- ❌ Delayed deployment
- ❌ Requires merge first

## 📋 Workflow Configuration Checklist

### NPM Setup
- [ ] Verify npmjs.com account access
- [ ] Check if trusted publishing is configured
- [ ] Verify package ownership (@lanonasis/cli)
- [ ] Test npm login locally

### GitHub Setup
- [ ] Workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- [ ] Workflow has correct permissions
- [ ] Repository has access to npm
- [ ] Branch protection rules allow workflow

### Testing
- [ ] Test manual workflow dispatch
- [ ] Verify build succeeds
- [ ] Check CLI tests pass
- [ ] Validate publish works

## 🎯 Recommendation for v3.0.3

**Deploy manually now, enable auto-publish later**:

```bash
# 1. Deploy v3.0.3 manually (NOW)
cd cli
npm publish --access public

# 2. Test installation
npm install -g @lanonasis/cli@latest
lanonasis --version  # Should show 3.0.3
lanonasis auth login
lanonasis status  # Should show "Authenticated: Yes"

# 3. Merge to main (AFTER TESTING)
git checkout main
git merge mem0-inspired-enhancements
git push origin main

# 4. Future releases will auto-publish
# Just push CLI changes to main
```

**Why this approach**:
- ✅ Get critical auth fix deployed immediately
- ✅ Test v3.0.3 in production
- ✅ Enable auto-publish for future releases
- ✅ No workflow configuration delays

---

## 📝 Summary

**Workflow Status**: ✅ Well-configured, needs NPM trusted publishing setup

**For v3.0.3**: Use manual publish (fastest path to production)

**For future releases**: Merge to main, auto-publish will work

**Action Required**: 
1. Manual publish v3.0.3 now
2. Verify trusted publishing setup
3. Merge to main after testing
4. Future releases auto-publish

---

**Next Command**: `cd cli && npm publish --access public`
