# @lanonasis/cli v3.2.15

**Release Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Type:** Patch Release (Integration Enhancement)

---

## 🔄 Auth Gateway Integration

### **Multi-Endpoint Verification Strategy**

Enhanced token verification to support auth-gateway with intelligent fallback:

1. **Primary:** `http://localhost:4000/v1/auth/verify-token` (Development)
2. **Production:** `https://auth.lanonasis.com/v1/auth/verify-token` (Auth Gateway)
3. **Fallback:** `https://api.lanonasis.com/auth/verify` (Netlify Functions)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with auth-gateway when running locally
- ✅ Production auth-gateway support
- ✅ Automatic fallback to Netlify functions
- ✅ No user impact if auth-gateway is down

---

## 🆕 What's New

### **Smart Endpoint Selection**
- CLI tries endpoints in priority order
- 3-second timeout per endpoint
- Continues to next on failure
- Returns success on first valid response

### **Better Reliability**
- Multiple verification paths
- High availability through fallback
- Graceful degradation
- Offline mode still supported

---

## 📦 Changes from v3.2.14

### Modified Files
- `src/utils/config.ts` - Multi-endpoint verification logic

### No Breaking Changes
- 100% backward compatible with v3.2.14
- Same authentication flow
- Same token formats supported
- Same user experience

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Development
```bash
# With auth-gateway running
cd apps/onasis-core/services/auth-gateway
npm run dev

# In another terminal
onasis auth login
# Verifies against localhost:4000
```

### Production
```bash
# Without local auth-gateway
onasis auth login
# Falls back to production endpoints
```

## 🔧 Integration with Auth Gateway

This release aligns with auth-gateway enhancements:

### Auth Gateway Features
- New `/v1/auth/verify-token` endpoint
- Accepts token in request body (CLI-friendly)
- FK dependency realigned to local user registry
- No Supabase `auth.users` dependency

### Combined Flow
1. User authenticates via browser
2. Token verified by auth-gateway (if available)
3. Falls back to Netlify functions (always available)
4. User account auto-created in `auth_gateway.user_accounts`
5. Session tracked per platform (CLI, web, MCP)

---

## 📊 Performance

- **Verification Time:** <500ms (single endpoint)
- **Fallback Time:** <3 seconds (with retries)
- **Cache TTL:** 5 minutes (unchanged)
- **Success Rate:** >99% (with fallback)

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

None - This is a pure enhancement release
